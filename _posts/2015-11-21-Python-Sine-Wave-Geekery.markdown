I was messing around with the Python's  Turtle graphics and wrote a short program to illustrate the idea that a sine wave is essentially a rotating circle moving through time. The blue line/dot represents the circle viewed from the side, and the yellow arrow is time. Pardon my throat clearing.

Another, static way to view the same idea can be seen below. The circles are moving through time, with each one spaced about .284 ms apart. The screenshot shows about 2.73 ms of time in total. As the circle spins, the height (y component) of the dot is the same as the amplitude of the sine wave.
