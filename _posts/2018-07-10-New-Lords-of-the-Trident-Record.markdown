Just finished mixing the new __Lords of the Trident__ record _Shadows from the Past_, and I can say without the slightest hint of bias that it is amazing. I've had the pleasure of working on three of the band's records now, and they just keep getting better and better. The songs are great, the writing is great, the singing is great, the playing is great, everything is great. It's without question right up there with the best things I've ever worked on. Don't take if from me, though -- listen for yourself!
