I'm Doug Olson, also known as Mr. Colson. I've been recording, mixing, producing, teaching and tinkering since... for a long time. I'm interested in music and art, math and science, electronics and programming. I do freelance work - check out the theme for the John Oliver show if you'd like to hear a recent mix - and I teach recording and music technology at the Madison Media Institute. Eventually, I'd like to have vignettes written to accompany each of the records in my discography. I may add a podcast as well.
