I mixed Use Your Weapons in 2013. Another great Vally Lodge record. "Go" is [the theme song for the John Oliver Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuORoSEGWYo), which is pretty awesome, if I may say so. I was definitely psyched when I got the news about that. The rest of the record is just as good. You can [listen to the whole thing here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-0H1kLFEWA), or just go over to iTunes and buy it.
