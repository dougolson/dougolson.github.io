The first major label record I worked on. Read about the night Paw and I went to see [The Dwarves]({% post_url 2015-10-14-Going-to-See-the-Dwarves-with-Paw %}) at the Club DeWash.

I Produced and engineered this one, Recorded at Smart Studios in 1992. Duke Erickson did a lot of engineering as well. Andy Wallace mixed it.

Give [Jessie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzJz9TIbjv8) a listen.
