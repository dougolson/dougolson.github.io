My role: Engineer, Basic Tracks

Cheap Trick was the first real rock concert I ever went to: September 15, 1979, at the Dane County Coliseum. Eddie Money opened. I only know this in such detail because someone has created a website that exhaustively documents every Cheap Trick concert ever to have taken place, although they missed the show at Madison West High School the year before I was a freshman. Needless to say, growing up in Madison, a hotbed of Cheap-Trickery, the band was a major component of the soundtrack to my teenage years. In 2002 I got a call saying that they were going to be coming through Madison in a few days and wanted to re-record Surrender - could I engineer? 

Um, yes.

We just recorded basic tracks - Bun E Carlos and Tom Peterson. They were amazing - incredibly tight. It was as if they were reading each other's minds as they played. I've tried to explain to a lot of young bands the difference between playing at the same time and playing together. Cheap Trick plays *together*. I'm sure if you loaded them into Pro Tools and put them on a grid, it wouldn't be perfect, but to chop it up and align it all it would be ruinous. What they have - what any great rhythm section has - is unique and human. You can capture it, but I don't think you can synthesize it with digital trickery.

The finished song is on the soundtrack to Daddy Day Care - a true milestone in the annals of cinematic art.
