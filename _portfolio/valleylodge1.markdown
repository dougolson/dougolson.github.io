I love this record. Drums were recorded in Brooklyn, guitars in Los Angeles, and the vocals in my living room in Madison. We made a vocal booth with blankets we bought at St. Vinny's, drilling holes in my ceiling and using clothesline and broom handles to hang them. I'm generally not a fan of vocal booths, but this approach works, because the booth hangs loosely within a much larger space. That way you avoid the resonances and cloudy sound most booths have. 

In any case, we all worked our asses off, and it's a great record. [Dave Hill](http://www.davehillonline.com/) and [John Kimbrough](http://www.johnkimbrough.com/) are two amazingly talented guys, and I've had the pleasure of working with both of them many times over the years.
