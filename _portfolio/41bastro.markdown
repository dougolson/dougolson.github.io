My role: Engineer

Producers Brian Paulson, John McEntire

I remember one song had this amazing, manic drum part - it was very "mathy" and chaotic. Every take was basically a one-off. As a joke, right after John finished a good take, Brian got on the talkback and said "Ok, John, now let's double it." John's eyes lit up - "Yes! That would sound amazing!  Give me a couple of minutes." He took out a manuscript book and had us play the song back a few times while he charted it out. After about 5 minutes, he said, "Ok, I'm ready." Brian and I were both like - "I'll be very surprised if this works." Well, we hit record and he nailed it in one take, sight reading as he played. We were blown away.
