Produced by Butch Vig in 1991

I assisted for the most part, although at Smart in those days roles weren't all that well defined. I did some engineering - recorded a few guitar overdubs - and generally helped out. Billy was an intense guy, very particular, but he was easy to work with because he knew what he wanted, and he could articulate it clearly. Watching Jimmy Chamberlin unleash on the drums was pretty unreal.
