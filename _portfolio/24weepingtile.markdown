[Weeping Tile - Cold Snap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFvPB4bq804&list=PL0fA4aAteWJGUm9XwH4Wojsgg-AQ6akOC)

Great record - smart writing, nuanced and compelling vocals from Sarah Harmer. I distinctly remember really liking the way this material was recorded, so much so that I called up the engineer to ask how he got some of the sounds. It was recorded at Grant Avenue in Hamilton, Ontario - a studio founded by Daniel Lanois. Apparently Daniel hung out for a couple of evenings during the recording of Cold Snap. I wonder if it had an effect on the record - it does have a nice atmospheric vibe to it.
