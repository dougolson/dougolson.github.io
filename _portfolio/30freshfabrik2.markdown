Another Budapest recording. I spent most of the summer of 2004 there. It was awesome. The band rented me a flat in Pest, and every day I'd go grab an espresso and catch the tram to Buda, followed by a short walk to Aquarium Studios. We'd work all day, then head out for dinner, usually at Szep Ilona, then work some more, then head out and drink too much red wine. Lots of intense conversations, lots of interesting people. I Even learned some Hungarian, which is a difficult but really beautiful language. Szeretem a Torok etel.
