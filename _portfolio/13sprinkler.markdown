Bob Mould put More Boy, Less Friend in his top ten list for 1992 in Rolling Stone magazine. I was pretty psyched about that. A few months later, I was siting at home and the phone rang: 

"Doug?"
"Speaking"
"This is Bob Mould..."

I was not expecting that. Totally nice guy - he was looking for an engineer to work with on the Magnapop record he produced. I already had a commitment lined up though, so I couldn't do it.
