			Bob Dylan: Tangled Up in Blue
		</p>
		<p class='verse'>
			Early one mornin' the sun was shinin'<br>
			I was layin' in bed<br>
			Wondrin' if she'd changed at all<br>
			If her hair was still red<br>
			Her folks they said our lives together<br>
			Sure was gonna be rough<br>
			They never did like<br>
			Mama's homemade dress<br>
			Papa's bank book wasn't big enough<br>
			And I was standin' on the side of the road<br>
			Rain fallin' on my shoes<br>
			Heading out for the east coast<br>
			Lord knows I've paid some dues<br>
			Gettin' through<br>
			Tangled up in blue
		</p>
		<p class='verse'>
			She was married when we first met<br>
			Soon to be divorced<br>
			I helped her out of a jam I guess<br>
			But I used a little too much force<br>
			We drove that car as far as we could<br>
			Abandoned it out west<br>
			Split up on a dark sad night<br>
			Both agreeing it was best<br>
			She turned around to look at me<br>
			As I was walkin' away<br>
			I heard her say over my shoulder<br>
			We'll meet again some day<br>
			On the avenue<br>
			Tangled up in blue
		</p>
		<p class='verse'>
			I had a job in the great north woods<br>
			Working as a cook for a spell<br>
			But I never did like it all that much<br>
			And one day the axe just fell<br>
			So I drifted down to New Orleans<br>
			Where I was looking for to be employed<br>
			Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat<br>
			Right outside of Delacroix<br>
			But all the while I was alone<br>
			The past was close behind<br>
			I seen a lot of women<br>
			But she never escaped my mind<br>
			And I just grew<br>
			Tangled up in blue
		</p>
		<p class='verse'>
			She was workin' in a topless place<br>
			And I stopped in for a beer<br>
			I just kept lookin' at the side of her face<br>
			In the spotlight so clear<br>
			And later on as the crowd thinned out<br>
			I's just about to do the same<br>
			She was standing there in back of my chair<br>
			Said to me, Don't I know your name?<br>
			I muttered somethin' under my breath<br>
			She studied the lines on my face<br>
			I must admit I felt a little uneasy<br>
			When she bent down to tie the laces<br>
			Of my shoe<br>
			Tangled up in blue
		</p>
		<p class='verse'>
			She lit a burner on the stove<br>
			And offered me a pipe<br>
			I thought you'd never say hello, she said<br>
			You look like the silent type<br>
			Then she opened up a book of poems<br>
			And handed it to me<br>
			Written by an Italian poet<br>
			From the thirteenth century<br>
			And everyone of them words rang true<br>
			And glowed like burnin' coal<br>
			Pourin' off of every page<br>
			Like it was written in my soul<br>
			From me to you<br>
			Tangled up in blue
		</p>
		<p class='verse'>
			I lived with them on Montague Street<br>
			In a basement down the stairs<br>
			There was music in the cafes at night<br>
			And revolution in the air<br>
			Then he started into dealing with slaves<br>
			And something inside of him died<br>
			She had to sell everything she owned<br>
			And froze up inside<br>
			And when finally the bottom fell out<br>
			I became withdrawn<br>
			The only thing I knew how to do<br>
			Was to keep on keepin' on<br>
			Like a bird that flew<br>
			Tangled up in blue
		</p>
		<p class='verse'>
			So now I'm goin' back again<br>
			I got to get to her somehow<br>
			All the people we used to know<br>
			They're an illusion to me now<br>
			Some are mathematicians<br>
			Some are carpenters' wives<br>
			Don't know how it all got started<br>
			I don't know what they're doin' with their lives<br>
			But me, I'm still on the road<br>
			Headin' for another joint<br>
			We always did feel the same<br>
			We just saw it from a different point<br>
			Of view<br>
			Tangled up in blue

			Joni Mitchell: Both Sides, Now
		</p>
		<p class='verse'>
			Rows and flows of angel hair<br>
			And ice cream castles in the air and feather canyons everywhere<br>
			I've looked at clouds that way<br>
			But now they only block the sun, they rain and they snow on everyone<br>
			So many things I would have done but clouds got in my way
		</p>
		<p class='verse'>
			I've looked at clouds from both sides now<br>
			From up and down and still somehow it's cloud illusions that I recall<br>
			I really don't know clouds at all
		</p>
		<p class='verse'>
			Moons and Junes and ferris wheels<br>
			The dizzy dancing way you feel when every fairy tale comes real<br>
			I've looked at love that way<br>
			But now it's just another show, you leave 'em laughing when you go<br>
			And if you care don't let them know, don't give yourself away
		</p>
		<p class='verse'>
			I've looked at love from both sides now<br>
			From give and take and still somehow it's love's illusions that I recall<br>
			I really don't know what love's about at all
		</p>
		<p class='verse'>
			Tears and fears and feelin' proud<br>
			To say to someone I love you right out loud<br>
			Dreams and schemes and circus crowds<br>
			I've looked at life that way, sometimes I still do<br>
			Now old friends are acting strange<br>
			They shake their heads and they tell me that I have changed, well I have<br>
			Something's lost but something's gained in livin' every day
		</p>
		<p class='verse'>
			I've looked at love from both sides now<br>
			From up and down and give and take<br>
			From win and lose and still somehow it's love's illusions that I recall<br>
			I really don't know, I really don't know

			Leonard Cohen: Bird on the Wire
		</p>
		<p class='verse'>
			Like a bird on the wire<br>
			Like a drunk in a midnight choir<br>
			I have tried in my way to be free
		</p>
		<p class='verse'>
			Like a worm on a hook<br>
			Like a knight from some old-fashioned book<br>
			I have saved all my ribbons for thee<br>
			If I, if I have been unkind<br>
			I hope that you can just let it go by<br>
			If I, if I have been untrue<br>
			I hope you know it was never to you
		</p>
		<p class='verse'>
			For like a baby, stillborn<br>
			Like a beast with his horn<br>
			I have torn everyone who reached out for me<br>
			But I swear by this song<br>
			And by all that I have done wrong<br>
			I will make it all up to thee
		</p>
		<p class='verse'>
			I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch<br>
			He said to me, "you must not ask for so much"<br>
			And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door<br>
			She cried to me, "hey, why not ask for more?"<br>
			Oh, like a bird on the wire<br>
			Like a drunk in a midnight choir<br>
			I have tried in my way to be free
		</p>

			Randy Newman, I Think Its Going to Rain Today
		</p>
		<p class='verse'>
			Broken windows and empty hallways<br>
			A pale dead moon in the sky streaked with gray<br>
			Human kindness is overflowing<br>
			And I think it's going to rain today
		</p>
		<p class='verse'>
			Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles<br>
			With frozen smiles to chase love away<br>
			Human kindness is overflowing<br>
			And I think it's going to rain today
		</p>
		<p class='verse'>
			Lonely, lonely<br>
			Tin can at my feet<br>
			Think I'll kick it down the street<br>
			That's the way to treat a friend
		</p>
		<p class='verse'>
			Bright before me the signs implore me<br>
			To help the needy and show them the way<br>
			Human kindness is overflowing<br>
			And I think it's going to rain today
		</p>

			Roger Waters: Wish You Were Here
		</p>
		<p class='verse'>
			So, so you think you can tell<br>
			Heaven from hell<br>
			Blue skies from pain<br>
			Can you tell a green field<br>
			From a cold steel rail?<br>
			A smile from a veil?<br>
			Do you think you can tell?
		</p>
		<p class='verse'>
			Did they get you to trade<br>
			Your heroes for ghosts?<br>
			Hot ashes for trees?<br>
			Hot air for a cool breeze?<br>
			Cold comfort for change?<br>
			And did you exchange<br>
			A walk on part in the war<br>
			For a lead role in a cage?
		</p>
		<p class='verse'>
			How I wish, how I wish you were here<br>
			We're just two lost souls<br>
			Swimming in a fish bowl<br>
			Year after year<br>
			Running over the same old ground<br>
			And how we found<br>
			The same old fears<br>
			Wish you were here
		</p>

			Walter Becker, Donald Fagen: Reeling in the Years
		</p>
		<p class='verse'>
			Your everlasting summer, you can see it fading fast<br>
			So you grab a piece of something that you think is gonna last<br>
			Well, you wouldn't even know a diamond if you held it in your hand<br>
			The things you think are precious, I can't understand
		</p>
		<p class='verse'>
			Are you reelin' in the years? Stowin' away the time<br>
			Are you gatherin' up the tears? Have you had enough of mine?<br>
			Are you reelin' in the years? Stowin' away the time<br>
			Are you gatherin' up the tears? Have you had enough of mine?
		</p>
		<p class='verse'>
			You been tellin' me you're a genius since you were seventeen<br>
			In all the time I've known you, I still don't know what you mean<br>
			The weekend in the college didn't turn out like you planned<br>
			The things that pass for knowledge, I can't understand
		</p>
		<p class='verse'>
			Are you reelin' in the years? Stowin' away the time<br>
			Are you gatherin' up the tears? Have you had enough of mine?<br>
			Are you reelin' in the years? Stowin' away the time<br>
			Are you gatherin' up the tears? Have you had enough of mine?
		</p>
		<p class='verse'>
			I spent a lot of money and I spent a lot of time<br>
			The trip we made to Hollywood is etched upon my mind<br>
			After all the things we've done and seen, you find another man<br>
			The things you think are useless, I can't understand
		</p>
		<p class='verse'>
			Are you reelin' in the years? Stowin' away the time<br>
			Are you gatherin' up the tears? Have you had enough of mine?<br>
			Are you reelin' in the years? Stowin' away the time<br>
			Are you gatherin' up the tears? Have you had enough of mine?
