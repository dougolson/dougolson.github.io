<p>Not Found. Found this instead:</p>

<p>The palm at the end of the mind,
Beyond the last thought, rises
In the bronze decor,</p>

<p>A gold-feathered bird
Sings in the palm, without human meaning,
Without human feeling, a foreign song.</p>

<p>You know then that it is not the reason
That makes us happy or unhappy.
The bird sings. Its feathers shine.</p>

<p>The palm stands on the edge of space.
The wind moves slowly in the branches.
The birdâ€™s fire-fangled feathers dangle down</p>
