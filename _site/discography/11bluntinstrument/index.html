    <p>This is the first recording I ever did that sounded really “pro” to me. The band had a lot to do with it - they always do. The songs and performances are strong, the arrangements are clean and uncluttered, and the players - Charlie Cronk on drums, Reid Johnston on guitar and vocals, Carl Lavine on bass, and the late Mark Beckley Roberts on guitar and vocals - were all solid. So they made it pretty easy to get a good sound. It was a milestone for me, nevertheless. After this I knew I could raise the bar a lot higher, and I had a better idea of how to do it. </p>

<p>Here’s the whole EP:
